//查询出来多余的重复记录（多个字段),不包含id最小的记录

SELECT * from ad_m_operator_config where(operator_mcc,operator_mnc) in (SELECT operator_mcc,operator_mnc from ad_m_operator_config GROUP BY operator_mcc,operator_mnc HAVING count(id)>1) 
and id not in(SELECT min(id) FROM ad_m_operator_config GROUP BY operator_mcc,operator_mnc HAVING count(id)>1);

//删除表中多余的重复记录（多个字段）,只留有id最小的记录

DELETE from ad_m_operator_config where(operator_mcc,operator_mnc) in (SELECT operator_mcc,operator_mnc from ad_m_operator_config GROUP BY operator_mcc,operator_mnc HAVING count(id)>1) 
and id not in(SELECT min(id) FROM ad_m_operator_config GROUP BY operator_mcc,operator_mnc HAVING count(id)>1);



1、查找表中多余的重复记录，重复记录是根据单个字段（peopleId）来判断
select * from people  
where peopleId in (select  peopleId  from  people  group  by  peopleId  having  count(peopleId) > 1)  


2、删除表中多余的重复记录，重复记录是根据单个字段（peopleId）来判断，只留有rowid最小的记录delete from people   
where peopleId  in (select  peopleId  from people  group  by  peopleId   having  count(peopleId) > 1)  
and rowid not in (select min(rowid) from  people  group by peopleId  having count(peopleId )>1)  

3、查找表中多余的重复记录（多个字段） 
select * from vitae a  
where (a.peopleId,a.seq) in  (select peopleId,seq from vitae group by peopleId,seq  having count(*) > 1)  

4、删除表中多余的重复记录（多个字段），只留有rowid最小的记录

delete from vitae a  
where (a.peopleId,a.seq) in  (select peopleId,seq from vitae group by peopleId,seq having count(*) > 1)  
and rowid not in (select min(rowid) from vitae group by peopleId,seq having count(*)>1)  


5、查找表中多余的重复记录（多个字段），不包含rowid最小的记录

select * from vitae a  
where (a.peopleId,a.seq) in  (select peopleId,seq from vitae group by peopleId,seq having count(*) > 1)  
and rowid not in (select min(rowid) from vitae group by peopleId,seq having count(*)>1)
